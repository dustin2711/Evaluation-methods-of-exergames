\section{Motivation}
Fitness video games, now referred to as exergames, gained a lot of popularity in the last years, mostly due to the development of cheap and small motion sensors. This is not surprising as they enable to combine the healthiness of sports with the motivating aspects of video games.
"There was moderate quality evidence that AVGs can result in benefits for self-esteem, increased energy
expenditure, physical activity and reduced body mass index in children and adolescents who used
AVGs in the home environment" \cite{santos2020active}
increased self-esteem in boys (p <0.05; ES: 0.58; 95\% CI: 0.08-1.07) and reduction of girls’ mental confusion (p <0.05; ES 0.58; 95\% CI 0.15-1.06).\cite{andrade2020effect}
They can adress health problem of video gamers as they are at a higher risk of being overweight \cite{melchior2014internet} or frequent online game players who report exercising at a lower frequency \cite{kowert2014unpopular}. Also elder people with less connections to video games can train their balance using exergames \cite{lai2013effects}. Playing Pokémon Go was shown to be associated with statistically significant number of daily steps \cite{khamzina2019impact}. This becomes more impressive considering that it is the third most popular smartphone game of all time \cite{link_pokemongo}. However, there are also studies coming to the conclusion that offering exergames, instead of regular video games, to children does not increase their physical activity under naturalistic circumstances \cite{baranowski2012impact}. 
To further improve exergames, reliable ways to evaluate them are advantageous. The available research mostly focused on pure videos games and serious games. Serious games are all video games which pursue another "characterization goal" aside from entertainment, e.g. fighting cancer cells in Re-Mission \cite{link_remission} was shown to help children with cancer to develop a more positive attitude towards their illness with positive health aspects, as shown in randomized controlled trials \cite{kato2008video}.
Exergames represent a subgenre of serious games with a focus on excersing i.e. body movements. As serious games benefit, due to their double mission, from specialiced evaluation methods \cite{caserman2020quality} in comparison to general video games, exergames again can benefit from evaluation methods that consider the involved physical activity. This paper will give insights to the challenges and possibilities.
"moderate-intensity physical exercise is good at improving emotional response to negative stimulations" [67]
Lack of physical activity is a significant contributing factor to preventable deaths in the American population \cite{bauer2014prevention}.

\section{Approach}
Three studies were proposed as interesting by the supervisor Polona Caserman who is an researcher in the field of serious games They acted as a good starting point for snowball sampling.
Other studies were often found using ChatGPT 3.5 with queries in the format of "list some studies about ..." which usually gave a good overview. Although the name of the listed studies were wrong many times, the author name and the release year could be used to find the related paper in Google or Google Scholar. 
E.g. the query "list some studies about to evaluation of exergames" led to these studies \cite{fogel2010effects} \cite{lai2013effects}.
To find evidence for several trains of thought or to answer upcoming questions, key words where put into Google Scholar, e.g. "Heart rate variability emotion" to find more about the connection of heart rate variability and emotions.

\chapter{Measuring outcomes}
"The [metastudy] results show that playing AVGs significantly increased heart rate, VO2 (oxygen consumption), and EE (energy expenditure) from resting" \cite{peng2011playing}

\section{Impact of training frequency of exergames}
One exercise per week led to no effects and three per week to medium effects while 2 exercises per week resulted in most effects  in most motor and selected cognitive outcomes. These outcomes wer measured by: 6-minute walk test (6MWT), body mass, self-reported physical activity, sleep quality, Berg Balance Scale, Short Physical Performance Battery, fast gait speed, dynamic balance, heart rate recovery after step test and 6 cognitive tests. \cite{hortobagyi2012effects}

\section{Impact of sport on psychology}
Anxiety reduction was shown after 20-minute treadmill run for experienced but not for inexperienced runners. \cite{hatfield87psychophysiology, boutcher86anxiety}
Exercise can lead to increased beta-endorphin levels causing an analgesic and "feel-better" effect \cite{hatfield87psychophysiology}. Also a muscle relaxation response could be found \cite{devries72electromyiographic, hatfield87psychophysiology}.
Physiological arousal of people with higher aerobic power (the ability of the muscles to produce energy using oxygen) is lower and recovers faster to base level which also effects emotions: People that were made angry in experiments, excercised and then sat for some time, showed more intensive emotions, ie aggresive behaviour, at lower fitness levels \cite{zillmann74attribution}.
Contrary to meditation and music appreciation programs, at long term, exercise led to a faster recovery the electrodermal response after applying different kinds of psychosocial stress \cite{keller84physical} while addtionally increasing physical fitness. Still, there are also many studies that did not come to the same conclusion which may also arise from habituation due to using the same social stressors \cite{hatfield87psychophysiology}.
A systematic review concluded that extrinsic motivation may be more influential in motivating individuals to start exercise in the short term, while intrinsic motivation may be more predictive in long-term.\cite{teixeira2012exercise} 
"Regular exercise is associated with emotional resilience to acute stress in healthy adults" \cite{childs15regular}.

When people feel motivated by their own choices and have their basic psychological needs met, they are more likely to have positive emotional experiences during exercise. However, for individuals who are externally regulated, perceiving the intensity of the exercise as high can help sustain a better emotional response. \cite{teixeira16needs}
One study proposed that changes in emotions, stress, and effort would be associated with the intensity of running, with high intensity conditions causing more change and being perceived as more stressful and effortful. This hypothesis was supported by the results from the 1.7 km experiment but not the 5.0 km experiment \cite{kerr2000effects}. As exergames rather use low intensities, prolonged sessions could be advantageous. 

One study compared the effects of Wii exergames and traditional exercise on subthreshold depression in older adults, finding that exergames had a direct negative effect on subthreshold depression, with positive emotions mediating this effect. Self-efficacy was not found to be a significant mediator. These findings suggest that exergames may be a valuable tool in reducing subthreshold depression among older adults and could be considered in its treatment. \cite{li17exergames}

\section{Impact of sport on psychophysiological measures}

\subsection{HRV}
As summarized by Makivic, during exercise, HRV typically shifts toward a higher LF/HF ratio, reflecting increased sympathetic activation and after exhausting excerise, towards a more parasympathetic activation.	\cite{makivic2013heart}

Sympathethic activity was shown to increase Electrodermal Activity but not the RMSSD  parameter of HRV.\cite{boettger2010heart}

\subsection{EEG}
Brain waves measured by EEG showed less latency after exercise-induced changes. \cite{reeves85endogenous} Also alpha brain waves showed 30-40 min increased magnitude after exhaustive tradmil walking which could be interpretes as an increased lack of attentiveness to the enivironmental surround \cite{hatfield87psychophysiology}.

Physical activity leads to increased heart rate \cite{hammond1985normal, boettger2010heart, haskell2007recommendation}, vigorous activity leads to rapid breathing and substantial increase in heart rate \cite{haskell2007recommendation}. This could make the emotion-caused fluctuations harder to detect although research on this area is rare.

\section{Smartwatches}
Energy expenditure: Fitbit Surge HR and TomTom watch(r = 0.62-0.69)
average HR: Apple Watch, Fitbit Surge HR, and TomTom watchr (r = 0.47-0.74)
Peak HR:  all smartwatches  (r = 0.59-0.65).  [58 Pope 2019 Validation of four smartwatches in EE and HR]

\chapter{Existing evaluation methods}
\label{ch:evaluationmethods}

There are multiple methods available to evaluate games with different characteristics. The methods can be applied during or after the gaming sessions. They can be subjectively, measured by a human and often the players themselves, or objectively using a device. These distictions create the following table.
 
\begin{table}[]
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
					& Live                                              & Afterwards\\

					& eye tracker, game metrics         				&\\                                                    
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}                                             								


\section{Questionnaires}
One important part to understand player's impressions towards video games are questionnaires as they can gather large amounts of data in a standardized way. One major drawback is that they need some time to complete and thus, are often conducted some time after the game was played. The Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) tries to solve this problem using a more concise In-game questionnaire \cite{poels2007game}. 




\subsection{The Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) Model}
The creators of this questionnaire claim that fun and satisfaction are outcomes of psychological processes and not the processes themselves \cite{rigby2007player}. So in order to create an entertaining game for the player, you need to unterstand the underlying processes und be able to describe the "underlying energy that fuels actions" \cite{rigby2007player}. Thereby, PENS is grounded on the well-established self-determination theory from the 1980s. Ut elicited validated measures in many fields \cite{pietrabissa2020development,lohmann2017measuring,richards2021further}. This theory suggests that there are three basic psychological needs \cite{deci1985intrinsic}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Autonomy: The need to feel in control of one's actions and have the freedom to make choices.
	\item Competence: The need to feel capable, effective, and skilled in one's pursuits or endeavors.
	\item Relatedness: The need to feel connected, supported, and engaged in meaningful relationships with others.
	\item -
	\item Presence/Immersion: emotional engagement in the game
	\item Intuitive Controls
\end{itemize}

Interestlingly, two of the three main factors, competence and relatedness, seem to be associated with positive emotions in long-term sport \cite{wienke2016qualitative} (like novelty seeking and physical exertion).

A study from 2018 found large support for the PENS \cite{johnson2018validation} and its categories presence, autonomy and relatedness. It proposed conclusion of Intuitive Controls into the Competence factor, especially if the players are more experienced with the game.

"the literature provides good evidence for the value of SDT in understanding exercise behavior". " intrinsic motives (e.g., challenge, affiliation, enjoyment) were positively associated with exercise behavior". "one study/sample performing correlational analysis to explore the links between health motives and exercise". "As expected from theory, controlled motives (social recognition, appearance/weight) did not predict, or negatively predicted, exercise participation". \cite{teixeira2012exercise}.
The disadvantage of high organizational effort that often goes with exercises \cite{mullan97variations} are not such a big deal in exergames.

\subsection{Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale}
The SAM is a tool to measure the emotional affective reaction in the dimensions pleasure, arousal, and dominance by letting the user point on pictures. [70] The Self-Assessment Manikin was used during balance exercises to measure the emotional state [69]. SAM was shown as a reliable and objective way to measure
emotions in VR Gaming [71].

\subsection{Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ)}
The Game Experience Questionnaire was developed 2007 by a European research project named FUGA \cite{poels2007game}. It is widely used in at least 515 papers \cite{law2018systematic}. The structure was developed by creating focus groups of gamers talking about their feelings about video games. Then some experts used the results and included theoretical considerations to come up with ten factors and 92 items with a 5-point Likert-scale from "not at all" (0) to "extremely" (4).
The questionnaire was tested with 380 participants referring to a game of their choice. After exploratory factor analysis on the results, a 7-factor solution with 82 items was concluded. It explained 52 \% of variance in all items with most questions havinge more than 30 \% correlation to only one factor. The seven factors are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Immersion (previously two factors Sensory and Imaginary Immersion)
	\item Tension (said to unforseenly emerged from Negative Affect although the factor Suspense already existed)
	\item Competence (includes previous factor Experienced Control)
	\item Flow
	\item Negative Affect
	\item Positive affect
	\item Challenge
\end{enumerate}
Two factors "Connectedness" and "Negative affective experiences related to playing with others" were shifted to an own questionnaire, the "social presence module" including another new category "behavioural involvement" .

A paper from 2018 did a systematic review using 73 studies that applied the GEQ \cite{law2018systematic}. Many critic points were found for both a GEQ itself but also for the studies that used it.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only 31 papers of 73 offered an explanation why the GEQ was used (31 because it is validated, 10 due to popularity, 8 due to multidimensional structure and 6 for being theoretically and empirically founded) 
	\item 47 Papers did not state the number of questions used whiel the GEQ offers a 33- and a 42-items version 
	\item Often times, papers used a selection of factors or items or adapted the items with mostly missing reasoning, partially explained by overlapping after using factor analysis 
	\item The used scale was not reported by 40 papers, 27 did not use the origin scale and 3 of them even used a mix of 5 and 6 answer options instead of 5 
	\item One main critic point was that there are two versions of the GEQ, from 2007 and 2013 with none of them formally publicated. The 73 analyzed papers referenced the 2007 version only once and the 2013 version not a single time. Often times, the GEQ was cited as "Manuscript in preparation" 
	\item 17 papers stated Cronbach's $\alpha$ for internal consistency of the factors with following values:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Flow and Competence: 0 7 to 0 94
		\item Positive Affect and Immersion: 0 49 to 0 85
		\item Negative Affect, Challenge and Tension: 0 3 to 0 74
	\end{itemize}
12 of these 17 papers stated low internal consistency, especially for challenge and negative affect 
No paper could reproduce the 7-factor structure but six proposed using six factors with Negative and Positive Affect being summarized as "joy" 
\end{itemize}

Finally, a validation study was conducted with 633 participants in an online survey (age = 33 47 ± 10 57, game experience = 19 5 ± 8 9 years) using the 33-items GEQ. A confirmatory factor analysis condluded that the factor Negative Affect is not satysfying due to a low reliability coefficient and the factor Challenge just barely. A exploratory factor analysis was conducted and came to the conclusion to remove some items that did not load well on the given or any other factor. Renaming Flow to "loss of time" was proposed. The Challenge factor only has 3 remaining items with need for filling up. Also Tension and Negative Emotion should be combined to one factor which results in these factors:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Immersion
	\item Competence
	\item Flow
	\item Negative Affect
	\item Positive affect
	\item Challenge
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately, the reviewing paper does not adress multiple issues.
What are possible readons why the results of the conducted study differ from the original study?
Are there maybe missing questions that could lead to new factor that the GEQ is missing?
Can the items of Negative and Positive Affect be summarized like in six reviewed papers? (with inverting the questions for Negative Affect)
Can the factor Challenge be added to the factor Competence with inverted questions?

Another validation study use exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to find partial support for the GEQ and large support for the PENS \cite{johnson2018validation}, also proposing to summarize negative affect, tension/annoyance and challenge to one single factor negativity.
	

\subsection{Flow State Scale}
The term flow was developed to understand the phenomenon of intrinsically motivated activity \cite{nakamura02concept}. It describes a positivly experienced state, where a person is totally in a task with challenge and skill level holding a perfect balance \cite{jackson1998psychological}. Further research has shown that, when experiencing flow, the perceived challenge level was rated slightly higher than the skill level with 8.3 to 7.3 \cite{jackson1996development}. Getting in flow state would be pleasant for exergames too also because it plays a role in motivation and enjoyment and people seem to show peak performance while in flow state \cite{jackson1996development, harris20review}.
To evaluate flow, there is a questionnaire called the "Flow State Scale". It originally consisted of 54 items with 9 factors but be reduced to 36 items while keeping a high reliabiliy with coefficient alphas rated above 0.80 \cite{jackson1996development} 
Here are the 9 original factors. A study with 1083 athletes proved an acceptable fit \cite{stavrou11confirmatory}. THe last two have the most potential for removal \cite{jackson1996development}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sense of Control
	\item Challenge-Skill-Balance
	\item Clear Goals
	\item Merging with task
	\item Unambigious feedback
	\item Concentration
	\item Loss of Self-Consciousness
	\item Transformation of Time (weakest factor, also shown to not have acceptable internal consistency \cite{vlachopoulus00confirmatory})
	\item Intrinsic motivation (may be more of a higher-order factor)
\end{enumerate}

Another study developed a flow state scale for occupational tasks in occupational therapy by letting the participants play video games and confirming that the computer game task used in the study represented measurable activities typically encountered in occupational therapy. By using a confirmatory factor analysis, they condluded three factors Sense of control, Positive emotional experience and Absorption by concentrating.
The total score on their flow state scale was negatively correlated with the total score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), indicating that the flow state was associated with lower anxiety levels.

\section{Psychophysiological measures}

\subsection{applicability in Videos games}
" Some of the earliest are from Mandryk and
Inkpen (2004) and Hazlett (2006), who have presented studies (albeit with
small sample sizes) supporting the use of psychophysiological measures in game research. More recently, Nacke (2009) and others have published studies as an attempt at a common methodology for a design-oriented approach. Their papers evaluate EEG (Nacke et al. 2010b), EDA, HR (Nacke 2009; Drachen et al. 2009) and facial EMG (Nacke 20" \cite{kivikangas2011review}
"clearly showed the necessity of proper experimental design and that care must be taken in interpreting the signals: otherwise, for instance, self-reported and physiologically indexed emotions may turn out to assess significantly different things"  \cite{kivikangas2011review}
"All these studies demonstrate that physiological signals are closely related to players’ self-reported emotional states and behaviour, while Chanel and others (2011) found support that the fusion of several physiological modalities increases the recognition accuracy. This shows that multiple measurements are still needed for a reliable interpretation of the player experience"  \cite{kivikangas2011review}








Psychophysiological measures can be a helpful way in evaluating exergames because they " provide an objective, continuous, real-time, noninvasive, precise and sensitive way to assess the game experience" \cite{kivikangas2011review}. 
"A large number of studies have shown that psychophysiological measures can be used to index emotional, motivational and cognitive responses to media messages" \cite{kivikangas2011review}
"physiological signals could be used, for example, at the player test phase to identify strong emotional
episodes and compare them to expectations, or to control the successful emotional elicitation of game event designed to be emotionally arousing" \cite{kivikangas2011review}
"Psychophysiological research is defined as using physiological signals to study
psychological phenomena (Cacioppo et al. 2007: 5)." \cite{kivikangas2011review}
The human body offers many ways to gain insights into someone's emotions state, e.g. heart rate and skin conductance together can be used to effectively recognize some basic emotions \cite{hamdi2015emotion}. Also, these measurements can be taken continously during the gameplay and can be mapped to a recorded gameplay session afterwards \cite{nacke2015physiological} which allows great post-analysis. Nonetheless, they should not be relied on alone. The researcher should always ensure the correct interpretation of the signals \cite{nacke2015physiological}, e.g. by validating them using other measurement methods like questionnaires 
One major drawback of these measures is that they are not only be affected by the game experience itself. Any movement with the body affects physiological measures, e.g. physical exercise results in heart rate increase \cite{javorka2002heart}. This can be obviously a problem in evaluating exergames where the body response usually consists of a psychological and a physical reaction. Aside from moving, also any stimulus in the environment that is not gameplay-related can be disturbing and affect the meausrement \cite{nacke2015physiological}. Also the demographic background of any person and the baseline of the measured variable in idle state should be taken into consideration \cite{nacke2015physiological} 
Although it is often hard to directly map physiological measurements to basic emotions, Russell’s circumplex model can be applied to simplify things. It uses just two dimensions valence ("pleasant/unpleasant emotion") and arousal ("low/high stimulation"). Positive and negative emotional valence can be assessed by using facial EMG \cite{kivikangas2011review}.They can be more easily measured and concrete emotions can be derived from them \cite{seo2019automatic} 
This is why many measuring methods are often not applicable for exergames which will be handled in the next chapter 
Another important point for exergames is portability and applicability during excercise. There may be games with heavy movement where a small or wireless measurement device may be advantageous 
Now comes an overview of measure possibilities. For more details, the just mentioned paper by Nacke 2014 is recommended 

\subsection{Facial Electromyography (EMG)}
Sensors will be attached to the skin and measure the eletric and such physical activity of muscles. They can be used to detect facial expressions. It was shown that eye \cite{ravaja2018phasic} and eyebrow muscles are a good indicator for positive and cheek muscles a good indicator for negative emotions \cite{nacke2015physiological,mandryk2006using}. 
Disadvantages are discomfort wearing face sensors, the inability to talk during gameplay and unnatural facial expressions due to feeling the sensor \cite{nacke2015physiological}
Also computer vision techniques can be used to obtain facial expressions but when discovering smiling, "The results showed that EMG has the advantage of
being able to identify covert behavior not available through
vision. Moreover, CV appears to be able to identify visible
dynamic features that human judges cannot account for" \cite{hernandez19invisible}

\subsection{Electrodermal Activity (EDA) / Skin conductance}
Two electrodes measure the conductivity of the skin. This is correlated to the sweat gland activity and that again is linked to emotional arousal \cite{nacke2015physiological, dawson2000electrodermal}. The measuring device can function wireless and be made out of soft materials \cite{kim2021soft} do not be disturbing during exercise 
The main disadvante is some seconds of latency which makes it more difficult to link a signal to a cause \cite{nacke2015physiological} 

"Significant covariation was obtained between (a) facial expression and affective valence judgments and (b) skin conductance magnitude and arousal ratings" \cite{lang93pictures}
"most drivers studied, skin conductivity and heart rate metrics are most closely correlated with driver stress level" [66]


\subsection{Cardiac activity / Heart Rate}
Heart rate was shown to effectively recognise all four basic negative emotions anger, fear, disgust and sadness \cite{levenson2003blood} and is tied to emotional arousal \cite{nacke2015physiological}. There are many possibilities to measure heart rates. Chest strap monitors are very precise and are affordable (75 €) \cite{link_herzfrequenzsensor} and also current smartwatches can deliver good results \cite{gillinov2017variable}.

\subsection{Heart Rate Variability}
The variability of the heart rate can be also obtained from measuring the heart rate but needs further analysis \cite{nacke2015physiological}. There is emerging analysis for its role in regulated emotional responding \cite{appelhans2006heat} with higher variability typically correlating with better emotional regulation [source?]. However, it was shown that heart reate variability alone is not that effective in recognizing emotions with a baseline below 50 \% \cite{ferdinando2014emotion}.


\subsection{Finger Pulse Volume (FPV)}
FPV was shown to be sensitive to changed in experimentally creates anxiety \cite{bloom77finger}.

\subsection{Electroencephalography (EEG)}
Electroencephalography is used to measure brain waves with a high temporal accuracy \cite{nacke2015physiological}. Some consider it as "ideal psychophysiological measure" as its "constantly fluctuating and continuously responsive to changing psychological stimuly" \cite{hatfield87psychophysiology}. The activity of different brain regions can be visualized but there is a lot of interpreation possibilities, especially since the origin of the brainwaves is not apparent \cite{nacke2015physiological}. At least it can be used to measure a player's engagement in a video game, e.g. there was increased activity when diing in. Super Meat Boy \cite{mcmahan2018evaluating}. With the Emotive EEG headset \cite{link_emotiv}, there is also portable technology available.
"Relatively greater left frontal activity indicates a propensity to approach a stimulus, whereas relatively greater right frontal activity indicates a propensity to withdraw from a stimulus (Davidson 1998). It must be emphasized that
frontal asymmetry is not a measure of positive or negative affect per se, but it taps a broader motivational tendency towards approach-related or withdrawal-related behaviours and emotions (Allen et al. 2001; Davidson 1998)" \cite{kivikangas2011review}
Alpha waves were found to be more prominent during tasks that did not require attention, such as mental arithmetic while beta waves were associated with emotionally positive or negative tasks, as well as cognitive tasks \cite{ray85eeg}.


\subsection{Respiration rate}
Studies reported higher respiration rate during arousal \cite{homma2008breathing}, increases in inspiratory time when laughing and decreases during disgust \cite{boiten1998effects}. Although this measure does not give as much insights as others, it can be well estimated from using heart rate sensors, so no addtional hardware is neccessary when heart rate is already measured. The root mean square error then is 0.648 per minute \cite{natarajan2021measurement}.

\subsection{Eyes}
"The best accuracy achieved by fuzzy integral fusion strategy is 87.59\%, whereas the accuracies of solely using eye movements and EEG data are 77.80\% and 78.51\%, respectively." to detect "positive, negative and neutral" emotions. Uses 33 different features just from the eyes (pupil diameter, dispersion, fixation, blinking, saccade (ruckartiges Verhalten))\cite{lu15combining}

\subsection{Body}
"To extend from psychophysiological measurements, there is some evidence that body movement and position (measured by acceleration sensors or position cameras) might be associated with
attention, interest and emotions (FUGA Contributors 2009; Kivikangas and
Ravaja in preparation)." \cite{kivikangas2011review}

\section{Comparing exergames with conventional interventions}

The effectiveness of exergames can be evaluated by comparing their outcomes with conventional interventions. Many evaluations methods and dependant variables are conceivable 

\subsubsection{Physical activity in inactive children}
A study from 2010 has shown the big potential of exergames for a physical education classroom \cite{fogel2010effects}. By the teacher's observation, four 5th grade class children did not move as much as other children. These "inactive" labeled children should be motivated to move more and participated in the study. 
Contrary to the default lesson where children played e.g. ball games, the exergame lesson consisted of 11 exergame stations. There, the children rotated every 10 minutes and played games like "Fit Interactive 3 Kick", a martial art simulator that uses three foam pads to be hit 
The measured variable was "physical activity" which was defined as moving a large muscle group. It was shown that the inactive children increased their physical activity from 1 6 min to 9 2 min during a lesson. This massive increase was only made possible by enhancing the time of opportunities for participating in excercises from 3 8 to 11 6 min. This was mainly reasoned by the fact that the teacher spent way less time providing instructions. 
It is unclear if the effects would persist longer than the given six weeks. Addtionally, the study relies on one single physiological measure as it spared measuring the heart rate in favor of saving time during the lessons. Still, the pure method of comparing exergames with a default setting enabled interesting insights and should be further examined.

\subsubsection{Balance training for elder people}
A study from 2012 evaluated the effectiveness of exergame exercises on balance improvement in older adults \cite{lai2013effects}. After six weeks of intervention, significant improvements were observed in typical balance tests such as the Berg Balance Scale. The positive effects partially persisted even after 6 weeks without further exercises. The exergame approach showed advantages in terms of feasibility and attractiveness compared to conventional exercises, due to instant and positive feedback and the more challenging nature. The study suggests the need for further research to examine the long-term effects and compare the exergame approach with traditional physical therapy.

Riding a bike while watching a bike tour video that gets played faster the faster you cycle was compared with riding a bike to play a video game with way more motivation for the video game. \cite{hardy2011adoption}

\subsubsection{PlayStation EyeToy intervention}
Playing active video games can help overweight or obese children who were current users of sedentary video games to improve their body mass index. This improvement is most likely because their aerobic fitness gets better \cite{maddison12avg}. There were 162 participants in the intervention and 160 in the control group, all having a Playstation 2 or 3 gaming console but no fitness video games. They received the neccessary hardware and a selection of Sony PlayStation fitness video games that use EyeToy, an addtional camera for the console, to detect body movements. They were encouraged to engage in daily 60 minutes of exergaming in periods of inactivity or traditional gaming. The study went 24 weeks and after 12 weeks, a bunch of new games was sent to the intervention group to ensure sustainability.
Outcome measurements were:
BMI (by measuring height and weight)
Body fat was assessed using standardized bio-electrical impedance analysis procedures
Aerobic fitness was assessed using the 20 meter shuttle test [12,13].
Seven day physical activity was measured objectively using accelerometry [14]
daily (for seven days) self-reported snack food consumption was assessed using a participant diary developed and tested in a previous pilot study [8].
Only aerobic fitness at 24 weeks met the conditions for mediation, and was a significant mediator of all treatment outcomes

\subsubsection{3 groups}
One study \cite{bock2019exercise} compared exercise videogames with standard exercise and control groups. The results showed that participants in the exercise videogame group had higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity and greater improvements in health risk indices, such as cholesterol and HbA1c, compared to the other groups. These findings suggest that exercise videogames can be an effective and enjoyable method to promote sustainable physical activity and achieve significant health benefits.

\chapter{Evaluation methods for exergames}


Exergames motivate the player to engage in physical activity, often by using modeling by a virutal trainer, feedback on the player's performance and reinforcement \cite{lyons13strategies}.
